# Digital Assignment 07: Absorb
Engulf your surroundings to grow and escape.

* **Controls:** Use the arrow keys to move around and absorb blocks.

* **High Concept:** Engulf your surroundings to grow and escape.

* **Player Experience Goals:**
This game is designed to have the player think in a logical way to solve puzzles. The necessity to absorb smaller blocks in order to grow and consume larger ones should push the player to think about their options. What moves they can preform to win and gain points.
This game is also designed to use audio to create a sense of scenery and environment. The goal is to create a memorable and sensory experience based solely off of the sounds.

* **Genre:**
This game is a puzzle solver with abstract graphic design.

* **Game play:**
To play move around the world and collide with the blocks to absorb them. Collect as much blocks as you can before the timer reaches 60s, at which point it is game over.The more blocks you absorb the larger you grow and the larger the blocks you can consume. When you collect all 24 blocks in the world you go on to the next level and your size is reset. Each level has its own challenges and puzzle. Complete all the levels to win the game and play again with a new random layout for each level.
Future updates may include the addition of shrinking as the blob leaves a trail, or possibly the inclusion of more block types with different effects.

* **Prototype goal:**
The goal of this prototype is to explore the use of sound as a key world and setting builder. The design is such that it conveys a chilling though of slime and moisture.
As a parallel goal this game is design to be a puzzle solver that incorporates collecting items to solve the puzzles.

* **Features:**
This game uniquely uses sound and random puzzles to create an atmosphere. The sound is memorable and the gameplay is simplistic and abstract.

* **Setting/Premise:**
This game is fairly abstract with the player playing as a giant slime that is trying to absorb as many blocks as possible. This blob has an unknown backstory and is therefore the subject of many scientific experiments.

* **Story:**
The player is a blob of slimy material that has developed a conciousness, but it also has gained a hunger. The blob needs to consume as many of these food blocks as quickly as possible. (This time constraint in the game play adds to the dramatic elements of the game.)
This mysterious blob has draw the attention of many scientists and even the public. Who created it? How does it live? Is it intelligent? Who knows what evil person could have dreamt this monster.
Target Audience:
This game is targeted towards fans of abstract sound based games. Fans of puzzle games will also enjoy the puzzle solving element.

* **Play time:**
This game takes 3-4 minutes to play all of the levels, but each level is randomized so there is replayability.

* **Strategies:**
The player will have to quickly work out a pattern to follow so they can grow but not get stuck.

* **Prototype Assets:**
The graphics are self-created and the following assets are borrowed:

 * Slime movement sound borrowed from StephenSaldanha: http://www.freesound.org/people/StephenSaldanha/sounds/158759/
 * Absorption sound effect borrowed from lolamadeus: http://www.freesound.org/people/lolamadeus/sounds/181916/

* **Prototype Closest Other Game:**
This game is self conceptualized, and some of my inspirations came from Katamari Damacy and Fat Princess.
