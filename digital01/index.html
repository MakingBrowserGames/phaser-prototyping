            <ul>
                <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> This is a fun-loving game
                    that should bring a warm feeling to the player's heart, at least
                    until night. At night the world changes and the cute pets become
                    evil nightmares instilling fear and panic in the player.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Genre:</strong> This game is a platformer with some horror
                    elements, the sudden change of the AI's attitude towards the
                    player.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Game play:</strong> The objective of this game is to collect
                    bones to tame to the different dogs around the world. It takes
                    one bones to tame a dog and prevent it from attacking at night.
                    The world will shift from day to night changing how the dogs
                    behave. During the day the dogs are calm and do not hurt you.
                    At night the dogs turn vicious and deal damage to you so avoid
                    them at all costs. The days only lasts a short time so grab the
                    bone and tame the dogs.
                    <br> To play this game use the arrow keys to move around and
                    to climb up and down ladders. You cannot jump so use the ladders
                    effectively.
                    <br> If you die, you will lose all of your inventory and respawn
                    at your original location. The world will not reset, however,
                    so all of the dogs you tamed will not respawn. Ten new dogs will
                    spawn throughout the map.<br> There are three different kinds
                    of dogs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Ordinary - <img src="assets/ordinary.png"> normal dog
                            that deals moderate damage and runs at a speed equal
                            to that of the player's
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fast - <img src="assets/fast.png"> faster dog that deals
                            little damage but runs at a speed exceeding the player's
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Heavy - <img src="assets/heavy.png"> strong dog that
                            deals a staggering amount of damage but runs at a speed
                            equal to half of the player's
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong> This prototype is exploring the
                    use of inconsistent AI and constantly changing world. This is
                    meant to create a sense of panic in the player as the attempt
                    to collect during the day and survive at night. This prototype
                    also explores the use of varying types of enemies with different
                    strengths and weaknesses.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Features:</strong> The change in the world from day to night
                    is an important and unique aspect of the game that changes how
                    players play and how AI react.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong> You are an adventurer and an armature
                    dog trainer. You have ventured into the territory of a pack of
                    deadly dogs that are influenced by the moon and become raged
                    at night. You take it upon your self to cure their anger by feeding
                    them tasty treats.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Story:</strong> You are a dog trainer who has come to the
                    wild lands to tame the wild night beasts.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> The target audience of this game
                    is primarily fans of the platform genre, but this game is designed
                    to appeal to many different people, as well. Fans of 8 or 16
                    bit games, and fans of classic console games will enjoy this
                    game.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Play time:</strong> The game time will vary depending on
                    your skill level, but most novices die in the first 2 minutes.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Strategies:</strong> The best strategy to use is to hide
                    on the ladders at night to avoid losing health. Do not forget
                    to get the bones though as they will help you in taming more
                    beasts.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong> Most of the assets are self created
