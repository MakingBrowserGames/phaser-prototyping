# Digital Assignment 04: The Road

Kill the people to collect brains and get a high-score.

You are a lone zombie on desert road. Defend yourself against the guns of the 
survivors and feast upon the flesh of the innocents. The goal of this game is to
kill the most innocent civilians with out being killed by the surviving 
fighters, blue clothed men. Each kill gives you 10 points, but each hit lowers 
your health by 10. Use the arrow keys to move around and collide with the 
civilians, orange guys, to attack them. Prototype goal: The main mechanic is to 
have the player start alone and then eventually control a whole herd of people.
