<strong>Controls:</strong> Use the arrow keys to move around and absorb blocks.

<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Engulf your surroundings to grow and escape.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This game is designed to have the player think in a logical way to solve 
puzzles. The necessity to absorb smaller blocks in order to grow and consume 
larger ones should push the player to think about their options. What moves they
can preform to win and gain points.<br>
This game is also designed to use audio to create a sense of scenery and 
environment. The goal is to create a memorable and sensory experience based 
solely off of the sounds.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is a puzzle solver with abstract graphic design.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, 
and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs 
and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that 
is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game 
not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of this prototype is to explore the use of sound as a key world and 
setting builder. The design is such that it conveys a chilling though of slime
and moisture.<br>
As a parallel goal this game is design to be a puzzle solver that incorporates
collecting items to solve the puzzles.
