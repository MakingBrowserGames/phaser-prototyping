The night is dark and full of terrors, so tame the beast before they attack.
</li>

around the world. It takes one bones to tame a dog and prevent it from 
attacking at night. The world will shift from day to night changing how the dogs
behave. At night the dogs turn vicious and deal damage to you so avoid them at 
all costs. The days only lasts a short time so grab the bone and tame the dogs.
There are 20 dogs in the world in total.<br>
To play this game use the arrow keys to move around and to climb up and down 
ladders. You cannot jump so use the ladders effectively.

collect during the day and survive at night. This prototype also explores the 
use of varying types of enemies with different strengths and weaknesses.
