            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Concept:</strong><br> This is a space ship flight simulator
                    that has the player launching a ship from an Earth-like planet
                    into space and to other planets all the while thinking about
                    fuel and other resources.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong><br> The goal of this game
                    is to have the player think critically about their decisions
                    on what resources to bring and have them learn about the physics
                    behind space ships. Also, a large goal is to create a fun game
                    that has the player coming back to try different resource loads
                    and to travel to different planets.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Genre:</strong><br> This game is a hybrid of the arcade space
                    ship genre (<i>Asteroids</i>,
                    <i>Lunar Lander</i>, etc.), the physics simulator genre, and
                    the
                    <i>Oregon Trail
</i>genre. It incorporates many physics and flight elements but
                    there is also an element of resource management like in <i>Oregon Trail</i>.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Game play:</strong><br> The player starts out by deciding
                    what resources to bring on their voyage. Each resource adds more
                    weight and therefore consumes more fuel. After the final resource
                    selection the player begins their game at the launch pad. From
                    the Earth-like planet the player can use their thrusters to get
                    into space and explore the solar system. The goal is to visit
                    and claim all the solar bodies for Science! <br> To visit a solar
                    body, first go to it in the solar map and then you will be taken
                    to its high atmosphere. From there the player must successfully
                    land on the planet in order to claim it.
                    <br> To control the ship use the UP arrow to turn on the engines
                    and thrust forwards, and the LEFT and Right arrows to rotate
                    clockwise and counter-clockwise respectively.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong><br> The goal of this prototype is
                    to incorporate more complex physics in order to make a fun game
                    that has the player thinking more mathematically about what their
                    ship is doing.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Features:</strong><br> The unique ability to traverse the
                    solar system and visit planets with different atmospheric pressures
                    (drag), and gravitational pull (gravity) creates a experience
                    other games like <i>Lunar Landers</i> or <i>Asteroids</i>.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong><br> You are a Space Ship pilot
                    who has been trained by the ESP, Earth Space Program, to fly
                    the solar explorer the Earth Space Ship, ESS for short. You mission
                    is to explore the solar system and claim the bodies in it for
                    Science!
                    <br> You have a deadly secret, however. One you would dare never
                    tell any of your supervisors.
                    <br> YOU NEVER LEARNED HOW TO USE THE AUTOMATED LANDING COMPUTER!
                </li>

                <li><strong>Story:</strong><br> As the captain of the ESS you are expected
                    to go out and claim the solar bodies for mankind, but the fact
                    that you slept through landing training slipped by and now you
                    have to try your best. Not knowing how to uses the automated
                    landing computer you figure your only chance is to land manually
                    putting your life in danger.
                    <br> META: This subtle story element leads to the entire danger
                    and dramatic tension of the game making it a changeling to succeed.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong><br> The target audience of this
                    game are physics fans as well as fans of resource conserving
                    games like
                    <i>Oregon Trail</i>.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Play time:</strong><br> This is a game of exploration with
                    several sights to see so the game play time can be long. Play
                    time also depends on how quickly the player masters the physics
                    and is able successfully land on their first try.<br> Certain
                    parts of the game take longer (ex. the Solar Map) because the
                    ship is slowed down in order to simulate the vast distance between
                    points.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Strategies:</strong><br> The best strategy is to reserve
                    fuel as much as possible and bring as much as possible. Fuel
                    becomes key especially when in the solar map and it is very important
                    to preserve it.
                    <br> It is important also to explore different solar bodies and
                    discover their secrets in order to be successful.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong><br> The artwork and animations
                    are all self created.<br> The following other assets were borrowed

                <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong><br> This game is inspired
                    by many other games including </i>Lunar Lander</i>, <i>
Kerbal Space Program</i>, and <i>Oregon Trail</i>. It incorporates gameplay elements
                    form each game to create a unique and fun take on the arcade
                    space simulator.
                    <br> Some of the physics and ship mechanics are borrowed from
