            <ul>
                <li><strong>Themes:</strong> Indirect control + a lot of randomness +
                    strategy + competitor</li>
                <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> The goal of this game is
                    to create a sense of distress in the player as they desperately
                    fight to defend their shores.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Genre:</strong> This game is a strategy tower defence game
                    that incorporates elements from the naval combat theme.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Game play:</strong> Use the mouse to click and place defence
                    ships anywhere in the water. Each ship cost 100 gold to build
                    and you can get gold by defeating attacking ships. When done
                    with placement press the start button to begin the attack. If
                    three ships reach your shores you loose. Ships spawn randomly
                    at the top of the screen and take a random amount of damage from
                    each shot.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong> The goal of this prototype is to
                    explore indirect control and the uses of player placed defences.
                    The player places their defences, but they have no direct control
                    over how and when the ships fire. This creates some conflict
                    as the player has to build in order to win.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Features:</strong> This prototype allows for the free placement
                    of defences in any arrangement the player chooses.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong> This game is set on the coast of
                    a kingdom and it is the players job to protect the kingdom from
                    on coming enemies.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Story:</strong> You are the admiral of a fleet of ships tasked
                    with protecting the shores from waves of on coming enemies. The
                    dramatic tension comes from the conflict of trying to protect
                    the land.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> The target audience is fans of
                    real time strategy games and the tower defence genre.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Play time:</strong> The gameplay of this prototype is quick
                    and easy with most games lasting in the single minutes.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Strategies:</strong> It will be important for the player
                    to spread out their ships so they have no weak spots. As the
                    game progresses it becomes more easy, so the level of attention
                    in the beginning needs to be high.
                </li>
