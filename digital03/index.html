            powers.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> The goal of this game is
                    to have the player strategize to balance limited resources, limited
                    attack count, with the impending threat of losing the game if
                    they do not attack.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Genre:</strong> This game is a action game that involves
                    waves of enemies coming towards the player.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Game play:</strong> During the course of this game enemies
                    will come from the right side of the screen towards you. If they
                    reach the tower you stand on you will die (lose the game). In
                    order to defend yourself cast elemental spells towards the enemies.
                    Hit the a enemy with your spell and you kill him.<br> This game
                    can be played exclusively with a pointing device, mouse or touch
                    screen. Click or press on the world to cast a spell towards that
                    point. Spells start in the sky and move towards the point pressed.<br>                    Future updates will expand upon the available spells adding a
                    upgrade system. True waves of enemies are also planned to be
                    added, replacing the quacking spawn mechanic.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong> The main mechanic of this game is
                    an increasing difficulty with each kill. Every kill causes enemies
                    to spawn faster and consequently drain your spells faster leaving
                    you vulnerable.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Features:</strong> The increasing difficulty as an effect
                    of the number of enemies killed is a unique feature of this game.
                    That paired with the limited number of spell and the random spell
                    spawn point makes for a fun and intensive game.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong> You are the last elemental sorcerer,
                    a breed of sorcerers who can control the four elements. You kind
                    has been wiped out by the federation army, a group of mortal
                    nations banded together to wipe magic kind from the face of Hosthus.
                    Defend yourself against the waves of oncoming enemies and try
                    to wound the federation as much as possible.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Story:</strong> Being the last elemental sorcerer you have
                    seen your whole kind wiped from the face of Hosthus. Now, when
                    your time is upon you, you choose to stand against all odds and
                    face the oncoming storm. Fight for your people, fight for all
                    magic kind.
                    <br> These men killed your friends and family it is time for
                    some payback.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> This game targets fans of action
                    games as well as fantasy and elemental magic. Fun and quick,
                    this game is great for anyone who wants to blow of some steam
                    and blow up some enemies.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Play time:</strong> The play time of this game varies depending
                    on the proficiency of the player. If the player is well trained
                    he/she could last many waves (~1min each).
                </li>

                <li><strong>Strategies:</strong> The player needs to be mindful of the
                    number of spells he has at any time. Spells will regenerate every
                    two seconds, but if the player runs out they will be defenceless.
                    The player also needs to compensate for the enemies' velocities
                    when aiming and consider that the spell spawn is random.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong><br> The majority of the assets
                    used, including the tileset, sound effects, and spell sprites,
                    are self-created.

                            Some code and mechanics borrowed from the the Game Mechanic Explorer:

                </li>

                <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong> This game draws heavily
                    from the wave action genre of games. The original idea was inspired
                    by and uses some mechanics of the Game Mechanic Explorer:
