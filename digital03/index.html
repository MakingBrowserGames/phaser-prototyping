<center><h2>The Last Elementalist</h2>
<strong>Controls:<strong> Click or press where you want to cast a spell. </center>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Defend yourself from the waves of on coming enemies using your elemental powers.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The goal of this game is to have the player strategize to balance limited 
resources, limited attack count, with the impending threat of losing the game
if they do not attack.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is a action game that involves waves of enemies coming towards the 
player.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
During the course of this game enemies will come from the right side of the 
screen towards you. If they reach the tower you stand on you will die (lose the
game). In order to defend yourself cast elemental spells towards the enemies.
Hit the a enemy with your spell and you kill him.<br>
This game can be played exclusively with a pointing device, mouse or touch 
screen. Click or press on the world to cast a spell towards that point. Spells
start in the sky and move towards the point pressed.<br>
Future updates will expand upon the available spells adding a upgrade system. 
True waves of enemies are also planned to be added, replacing the quacking spawn
mechanic. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The main mechanic of this game is an increasing difficulty with each kill. Every
kill causes enemies to spawn faster and consequently drain your spells faster 
leaving you vulnerable.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The increasing difficulty as an effect of the number of enemies killed is a 
unique feature of this game. That paired with the limited number of spell and 
the random spell spawn point makes for a fun and intensive game.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are the last elemental sorcerer, a breed of sorcerers who can control the 
four elements. You kind has been wiped out by the federation army, a group of 
mortal nations banded together to wipe magic kind from the face of Hosthus. 
Defend yourself against the waves of oncoming enemies and try to wound the 
federation as much as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Being the last elemental sorcerer you have seen your whole kind wiped from the 
face of Hosthus. Now, when your time is upon you, you choose to stand against 
all odds and face the oncoming storm. Fight for your people, fight for all magic
kind.<br>
These men killed your friends and family it is time for some payback.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game targets fans of action games as well as fantasy and elemental magic.
Fun and quick, this game is great for anyone who wants to blow of some steam 
and blow up some enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The play time of this game varies depending on the proficiency of the player.
If the player is well trained he/she could last many waves (~1min each).
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player needs to be mindful of the number of spells he has at any time. 
Spells will regenerate every two seconds, but if the player runs out they will 
be defenceless. The player also needs to compensate for the enemies' velocities
when aiming and consider that the spell spawn is random.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong><br>
The majority of the assets used, including the tileset, sound effects, and spell
 sprites, are self-created. <br>
