You are an retired general for the federation military. After seeing the horrors
of war, you wanted nothing but to live your last days in peace at the local 
tavern. When the princess' new born kittens go missing you decide to sober up 
for one last good deed. Hired as a royal mercenary, you travel to the desert town
to the east, the entrance to the black silk road. You figure you might be 
able to find some leads. Little do you know, this case is just the beginning and 
soon you cannot just stand by, you must put a stop to the cruelties of this world.

The goal of this game is to have the player interact with the NPC's in order to 
solve mysteries and complete the game.

characters to interact with them. Talk to the various character of the world to 
gain clues about who stole the kittens. Once enough clues have been found you 
can find the little ones. In future developments more playable area may be added
