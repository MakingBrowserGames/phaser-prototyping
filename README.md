# Digital Assignment 06: SpaceSim

Controls: Use the UP arrow to turn on the engines and thrust forwards, 
and the LEFT and Right arrows to rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise 
respectively.

Change Log:

Update 01: (04/16/2015 08:52:41 EST)
New title screen with background music and a play button.
New satellite wreckage in the Solar Map that can be used to salvage fuel for 
interplanetary travel.
New asteroid field in the Solar Map and a corresponding exploration level.
Asteroid belt stretches the height of the Solar Map screen and lies between the 
desert and ice planets.
Includes an exploration level where the player must maneuver to avoid
collisions with asteroids.
Three different asteroid sprites.
Acts as a barrier to get to the last planet in the Solar Map.

High Concept:
This is a space ship flight simulator that has the player launching a ship from 
an Earth-like planet into space and to other planets all the while thinking 
about fuel and other resources.

Player Experience Goals:
The goal of this game is to have the player think critically about their 
decisions on what resources to bring and have them learn about the physics 
behind space ships. Also, a large goal is to create a fun game that has the 
player coming back to try different resource loads and to travel to different 
planets.

Genre:
This game is a hybrid of the arcade space ship genre (Asteroids, Lunar Lander, 
etc.), the physics simulator genre, and the Oregon Trail genre. It incorporates 
many physics and flight elements but there is also an element of resource 
management like in Oregon Trail.

Game play:
The player starts out by deciding what resources to bring on their voyage. 
Each resource adds more weight and therefore consumes more fuel. After the 
final resource selection the player begins their game at the launch pad. From 
the Earth-like planet the player can use their thrusters to get into space and 
explore the solar system. The goal is to visit and claim all the solar bodies 
for Science!

To visit a solar body, first go to it in the solar map and then you will be 
taken to its high atmosphere. From there the player must successfully land on 
the planet in order to claim it.

To control the ship use the UP arrow to turn on the engines and thrust forwards,
and the LEFT and Right arrows to rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise 
respectively.
 
Prototype goal:
The goal of this prototype is to incorporate more complex physics in order to 
make a fun game that has the player thinking more mathematically about what 
their ship is doing.
Features:
The unique ability to traverse the solar system and visit planets with different
atmospheric pressures (drag), and gravitational pull (gravity) creates a 
experience other games like Lunar Landers or Asteroids.
 
Setting/Premise:
You are a Space Ship pilot who has been trained by the ESP, Earth Space Program,
to fly the solar explorer the Earth Space Ship, ESS for short. You mission is 
to explore the solar system and claim the bodies in it for Science! 
You have a deadly secret, however. One you would dare never tell any of your 
supervisors.
YOU NEVER LEARNED HOW TO USE THE AUTOMATED LANDING COMPUTER!

Story:
As the captain of the ESS you are expected to go out and claim the solar bodies 
for mankind, but the fact that you slept through landing training slipped by and
now you have to try your best. Not knowing how to uses the automated landing 
computer you figure your only chance is to land manually putting your life in 
danger.
META: This subtle story element leads to the entire danger and dramatic tension 
of the game making it a changeling to succeed.

Target Audience:
The target audience of this game are physics fans as well as fans of resource 
conserving games like Oregon Trail.

Play time:
This is a game of exploration with several sights to see so the game play time 
can be long. Play time also depends on how quickly the player masters the 
physics and is able successfully land on their first try.
Certain parts of the game take longer (ex. the Solar Map) because the ship is 
slowed down in order to simulate the vast distance between points.

Strategies:
The best strategy is to reserve fuel as much as possible and bring as much as 
possible. Fuel becomes key especially when in the solar map and it is very 
important to preserve it.
It is important also to explore different solar bodies and discover their 
secrets in order to be successful.

Prototype Closest Other Game:
This game is inspired by many other games including Lunar Lander, Kerbal Space 
Program, and Oregon Trail. It incorporates gameplay elements form each game to 
create a unique and fun take on the arcade space simulator.
Some of the physics and ship mechanics are borrowed from the Game Mechanic 
Explorer: Space Ship Motion examples as well as the Phaser P2 Physics example, 
Collision Groups.
