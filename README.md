# Doggies (Digital Assignment 01)

This is the GitHub repository for the game "Doggies". This repository was created by Zachary Ferguson for CS325 Digital Assignment 01. 


High Concept: The night is dark and full of terrors, so tame the beast before they attack.

Player Experience Goals: This is a fun-loving game that should bring a warm feeling to the player's heart, at least until night. At night the world changes and the cute pets become evil nightmares instilling fear and panic in the player.

Genre: This game is a platformer with some horror elements, the sudden change of the AI's attitude towards the player.

Game play: The objective of this game is to collect bones to tame to the different dogs around the world. It takes one bones to tame a dog and prevent it from attacking at night. The world will shift from day to night changing how the dogs behave. At night the dogs turn vicious and deal damage to you so avoid them at all costs. The days only lasts a short time so grab the bone and tame the dogs. There are 20 dogs in the world in total.
To play this game use the arrow keys to move around and to climb up and down ladders. You cannot jump so use the ladders effectively.

Prototype goal: This prototype is exploring the use of inconsistent AI and constantly changing world. This is meant to create a sense of panic in the player as the attempt to collect during the day and survive at night. This prototype also explores the use of varying types of enemies with different strengths and weaknesses.

Features: The change in the world from day to night is an important and unique aspect of the game that changes how players play and how AI react.

Setting/Premise: You are an adventurer and an armature dog trainer. You have ventured into the territory of a pack of deadly dogs that are influenced by the moon and become raged at night. You take it upon your self to cure their anger by feeding them tasty treats.

Story: You are a dog trainer who has come to the wild lands to tame the wild night beasts.
Target Audience: The target audience of this game is primarily fans of the platform genre, but this game is designed to appeal to many different people, as well. Fans of 8 or 16 bit games, and fans of classic console games will enjoy this game.

Play time: The game time will vary depending on your skill level, but most novices die in the first 2 minutes.

Strategies: The best strategy to use is to hide on the ladders at night to avoid losing health. Do not forget to get the bones though as they will help you in taming more beasts.

The player's sprite was borrowed from the Phaser Tutorial: Making your first Phaser game as well as some of the code and game play.
