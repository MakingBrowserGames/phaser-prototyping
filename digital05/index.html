                <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> This game is designed to
                    produce a experience of close calls and quick reactions for the
                    player. The automatic acceleration of the car forces the player
                    to react quickly and puts them in a state of flow as they swerve
                    around the map.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Genre:</strong> This game mostly draws elements from the
                    puzzle genre, but also incorporates mechanics from the racing
                    genre.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Game play:</strong> The player controls a yellow sports car
                    by using the right and left arrows to move in their respective
                    direction. The car automatically accelerates forward up to a
                    maximum speed. The player's car is surrounded by traffic and
                    in order to get through he/she must swerve around them. Any head
                    on collisions will damage the player's car. If the player's car
                    takes more than 100 damage they will have totalled it and loose
                    the game. If the player makes it to the front of the traffic
                    they will win. The player is being timed as well but it is only
                    used for determining high scores.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong> The goal of this game is to create
                    a quick but challenging game that requires concentration and
                    precision. This game is designed to put the player in a state
                    of "flow."
                </li>

                <li><strong>Features:</strong> Unlike most racing games there are no
                    opponent or clock to race against. Instead this game is more
                    of a reaction puzzle racing game that requires precise motion.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong> You are a new proud owner of a
                    fast yellow sports car, but you are currently stuck in traffic,
                    unable to test your new rides power. You have had enough of sitting
                    and decide to make your own route through. You decide to cut
                    in between traffic to try and get ahead.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Story:</strong> The dramatic tension arises from your inability
                    to drive fast and enjoy life. Fed up with waiting around you
                    have to break some laws, and maybe some fenders, to have some
                    fun.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> The main demographic for this game
                    is fans of puzzle runner games that have the player avoiding
                    obstacles as they progress forward endlessly.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Play time:</strong> This game is a quick game that can be
                    beat in a matter of minutes.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Strategies:</strong> The player will need to have fast reflexes
                    and a quick finger to move in between the cars and succeed.
                </li>

                    self created, and the following are used with the permission
