            <ul>

                <li><strong>Theme:</strong> Keyboard + deterministic + adventure + Collector
                </li>

                <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> The goal is to have the
                    player be fearful of the environment but also to want to explore.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Genre:</strong> This game falls in the adventure and dungeon
                    crawling genre.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Game play:</strong> The player moves around with the arrow
                    keys avoiding obstacles and trying to escape the maze. All the
                    while the torch is running out and the light is fading making
                    it increasingly harder to play. To escape the player must get
                    the key and find the door, but there are saw blades standing
                    in the way.<br> In future updates the tile set will be updated,
                    the torch will be refuel-able, and gold or other treasure will
                    be added.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong> The goal of this prototype is to
                    examine the effects of sensory and environmental deprivation
                    as the player can see little around them.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Features:</strong> This game features a unique take on the
                    adventure dungeon genre by limiting the amount of area the player
                    can see and by continually shrinking the view radius.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong> You are an adventurer trapped in
                    a maze of deadly obstacles. It is your job to find the key and
                    escape the death trap.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Story:</strong> The dramatic tension of the game comes from
                    the fading light and its effects on the players ability to see
                    obstacles.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> This game is targeted at fans of
                    adventures and dungeon crawlers like the original Legend of Zelda.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Play time:</strong> This game takes a short amount of time
                    to explore the one level available.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Strategies:</strong> The maze is a tricky puzzle so it is
                    important to explore all paths.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong> All sprites in the game are self
                    made and the sound effects where made using
